       <h2 class="middle">Ptolemy</h2>
       <div class="columns">  
           
            <p> Claudius Ptolemy was an Astronomer and Mathematician living in Egypt around 100-170AD. His most
                famous work is called the Almagest,"The Greatest", in which he describes a model of the 
                Solar System in great detail.</p> 
            <p> The Almagest is complicated and based on ancient mathematics and date/time systems. Few
                people have read it, resulting in many false and over-simple explanations. I hope these
                animations will help to explain, and demonstrate the elegance of, Ptolemy's models.</p>
            <p> Various translations of the Almagest have existed over the centuries and the diagrams here are
                based on <b>Ptolemy's Almagest</b> by G. J. Toomer, Duckworth, 1984 and <b>A Survey of the Almagest by Olaf Pedersen</b> (1974) revised by 
                Alexander Jones, Springer 2011.</p>
            <p> Ptolemy's stated intention was to extend and complement the works of earlier observers and philosophers. 
                He used observations from the Babylonian Astronomical Diaries going back over 800 years together with 
                those of Greek philosophers and his own measurements made in Alexandria.</p>
       </div>
       <h2 class="middle">The Models</h2>
       <div class="columns"> 
            <p>The models are based on Greek philosophy where it was held that the planets must move in 
                <b>"uniform circular motions, since these are proper to the nature of divine beings..."</b>. 
                Clearly there is difficulty in representing planetary orbits in this way. Ptolemy used circles 
                but compromised over the positioning of the circles and the uniform motion. </p>
            <p> In each model, the Earth is in the centre of the Universe and consists of the spheres
                of earth, water, air and fire as described by Aristotle. All planets, including Sun and Moon,
                orbit round the Earth.
            <p> Ptolemy used the Ecliptic as his reference plane and the Vernal  
                Equinox as his reference point. Coordinates of planets are described in terms of longitude
                round the ecliptic from the equinox and latitude north or south of the ecliptic.It was known that 
                the equinox moves about about 1 degree per century relative to the stars, but it was 
                believed this was due to the stars moving, not the equinox. </p>
            <p> Each planet has its own model and each model has a similar scale. Ptolemy did not
                try to lay out all the models in a complete solar system. In fact he was not sure in what
                sequence the planets should appear. All the models have a radius of 60 "partes", where a "parte"
                is an arbitrary unit of measurement.</p>

       <h2 class="middle">Planetary Hypothesis</h2>  
       <div class="columns">
            <p> Ptolemy also published a work called the Planetary Hypothesis which is sometimes
                regarded as a supplement to the Almagest. In this work, Ptolemy made some small adjustments 
                to the parameters of the orbits and some major changes to the way latitude is calculated.</p> 
            <p>I have adopted these new values and theories to the extent they are described in Pederson(1974).
                In particular the theories of latitude represent a 
                much more realistic representation of orbital inclination than those in the Almagest.</p>

       <h2 class="middle">Animations</h2>
       <div class="columns">
           <p>Each model is presented as an animated diagram on the left and scrollable text on the right</p>
           <p>A set of tools above the diagram allow to stop/start, zoom in/out, tilt, rotate 
               and control speed. </p>
           <p> Mouse drag can be used to shift the diagram so you can examine different areas in detail. </p>
           <p>The animation code is written in Javascript, developed using Netbeans, and deployed
               on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) using Fleek. </p>

           as is a PDF document describing the models in more detail.</p>
