       <h2 class="middle">Ptolemy</h2>
       <div class="columns">  
           
            <p> Claudius Ptolemy was an Astronomer and Mathematician living in Egypt around 100-170AD. His most
                famous work is the Almagest(المجسطي),"the greatest", in which he describes a model of the 
                Solar System in great detail.</p> 
            <p> The Almagest is very complicated and based on ancient mathematics and date/time systems. Very few
                people have actually read it, resulting in many false and over-simple explanations. </p>
            <p> Various translations have existed
                over the centuries and the diagrams here are based on <b>Ptolemy's Almagest</b> by G. J. Toomer, Duckworth, 1984 and
                <b>A Survey of the Almagest by Olaf Pedersen</b> (1974) revised by 
                Alexander Jones, Springer 2011.</p>
            <p> Ptolemy's stated intention was to extend and complement the works of earlier observers and philosophers. 
                He used observations from the Babylonian Astronomical Diaries going back over 700 years together with 
                those of Greek philosophers and his own measurements made in Alexandria.</p>
            <p> Much of his cosmic "model" 
                comes from Hipparchus extended as by his own ideas and theories. Hipparchus had 
                produced models for the Sun and Moon but Ptolemy extended them to all the known planets.</p>
       </div>
       <h2 class="middle">Coordinates and Scale</h2>
       <div class="columns">  
            <p> Ptolemy elected to use the Ecliptic as his reference plane and the Vernal  
                Equinox as his reference point. So the coordinates of planets are described in terms of longitude
                (from the equinox) and latitude (north and south of the ecliptic).It was known that 
                the equinox moves about about 1 degree per century relative to the stars, but it was 
                believed this was due to the stars moving, not the equinox. </p>
            <p> Each planet has its own models and each model has a similar scale. Ptolemy did not
                try to lay out all the models in a complete solar system. In fact he was not sure in what
                sequence the planets should appear. All the models have a radius of 60 "partes", where a "parte"
                is an arbitrary unit of measurement.

       <h2 class="middle">Planetary Hypothesis</h2>  
       <div class="columns">
            <p> Ptolemy also published a work called the Planetary Hypothesis which is sometimes
                regarded as a supplement to the Almagest. In this work, Ptolemy made some small adjustments 
                to the parameters of the orbits and some major changes to the way Altitude is calculated.</p> 
            <p>I have adopted these new theories of Altitude in the diagrams shown here as they represent a 
                much more realistic representation of orbital inclination than those in the Almagest.</p>

       <h2 class="middle">Animations</h2>
       <div class="columns">
           <p>Each model is presented as an animated diagram on the left and scrollable text on the right</p>
           <p>A set of tools above the diagram allow to stop/start, zoom in/out, tilt, rotate 
               and control speed. </p>
           <p> Mouse drag can be used to shift the diagram so you can examine different areas in detail. </p>
           <p>The animation code is written in Javascript, developed using Netbeans, and deployed
               on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) using Fleek. </p>
