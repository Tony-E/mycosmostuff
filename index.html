            <h2> Ptolemy </h2>
            <p> Claudius Ptolemy was an Astronomer and Mathematician living in Egypt around 100-170AD. His most
                famous work is the Almagest(المجسطي),"the greatest", in which he describes a model of the 
                Solar System in great detail.</p> 
            <p> The Almagest is very complicated and based on ancient mathematics and date/time systems. Very few
                people have actually read it, resulting in many false and over-simple explanations. </p>
            <p> Various translations have existed
                over the centuries and the diagrams here are based on <b>Ptolemy's Almagest</b> by G. J. Toomer, Duckworth, 1984 and
                <b>A Survey of the Almagest by Olaf Pedersen</b> (1974) revised by 
                Alexander Jones, Springer 2011.</p>
            <p> Ptolemy's stated intention was to extend and complement the works of earlier observers and philosophers. 
                He used observations from the Babylonian Astronomical Diaries going back over 700 years together with 
                those of Greek philosophers and his own measurements made in Alexandria.</p>
            <p> Much of his cosmic "model" 
                comes from Hipparchus extended as by his own ideas and theories. </p>
