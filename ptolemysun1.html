                            <h2 class='sideTitle'> Ptolemy's Sun </h2>
                        <p>Ptolemy based his theory of the Sun on the work of Hipparchus. </p>  
                        <p>The Earth is in the centre of the Universe and consists of the “spheres” of earth, water, air and fire, 
                                as described by Aristotle.</p>  
                        <p>The ecliptic is the reference plane and the vernal equinox <b class='sbold'>ϒ</b> is the reference point.
                           Coordinates are described in terms of degrees longitude (relative to <b class='sbold'>ϒ</b>) and latitude relative to the ecliptic. 
                           Latitude is therefore always zero for the Sun. </p> 
                        
                        <p>The Sun rotates round the Earth once per year. However, the apparent angular velocity of the
                           Sun varies during the year. We now know this is due to the eccentricity of Earth’s orbit 
                           round the Sun. This effect can be approximated by having the Sun move at uniform speed round
                           a circle with its centre some distance from the centre of the Earth. This is known as a 
                           deferent circle.</p>
                        <p>One year is the time for the Sun to return to the same ecliptic longitude - one tropical year. 
                           The sidereal year, return to the same point relative to the stars, is not used. It was
                           believed that the “sphere of fixed stars” rotated round Earth one degree per century to 
                           account for what we now call "precession of the equinoxes". </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ptolemy uses Hipparchus’s year which is 6 minutes too 
                                long due to measurement errors – 365d 5h 55m 12s. The 6m has 
                                consequences for the accuracy of all his planetary motion models.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> The Sun moves at uniform speed round a deferent circle centred at point <b class='sbold'>D</b> 
                            some distance from the centre of Earth.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This point is called the eccentric, and it needs to be placed 1/24th of the radius of the deferent circle 
                                in the the direction of longitude 65.5° <b class='sbold'>(λa)</b>. This angle was assumed to be fixed but 
                                we now know it moves very slowly due to the precession of the Earth’s orbit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The mean Sun <b class='sbold'>λm☉</b> shows the longitude the Sun would have if it rotated round
                            Earth at a uniform angular rate.</p>  
                                        
                        <p>The animation starts at noon on the 1st day of the month of Thoth in the first year of the reign of Babylonian King
                            Nabonassar.(Feb 26th 747BC). This is the "epoch" used for Ptolemy's planetary models as they
                            were calibrated from observations beginning near that time. </p>
