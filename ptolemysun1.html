                        <ul> 
                            <li>Ptolemy bases his theory of the Sun on the work of Hipparchus. </li>
                            <li>The Earth is in the centre of the Universe and consists of the “spheres” of earth, water, air and fire, 
                                as described by Aristotle.</li>  
                            <li>The Sun revolves around the Earth in a "deferent" circle.</li>
                            <li>The ecliptic is the reference plane and the vernal equinox <b class='sbold'>ϒ</b> is the reference point.</li> 
                            <li>Coordinates are described in terms of longitude (relative to <b class='sbold'>ϒ</b>) and latitude relative to the ecliptic. 
                                So latitude is always zero for the Sun. </li>   
                            <li>One year is the time from equinox to equinox, i.e. one tropical year. 
                                (The sidereal year - return to same point relative to the stars - is not used because 
                                the “sphere of fixed stars” is believed to rotate slowly to compensate for what 
                                we now call "precession of the equinoxes". </li>
                            <li>Ptolemy uses Hipparchus’s year which is 6 minutes too 
                                long due to measurement inaccuracy and refraction – 365d 5h 55m 12s. The 6m has 
                                consequences for the accuracy of all his planetary motion models.</li>
                            <li>The apparent angular velocity of the Sun varies during the year. We now know this is due to the 
                                eccentricity of Earth’s orbit round the Sun. The effect can be approximated by having the Sun 
                                move at uniform speed round the a point <b class='sbold'>E</b> some distance from the centre of the Earth. 
                                (Zoom in to see.) </li>
                            <li>This point is called the eccentric, and it needs to be placed 1/24th of the radius of the circle 
                                in the the direction of longitude 65.5° <b class='sbold'>(λa)</b>. This angle was assumed to be fixed but we now know it moves 
                                very slowly due to the precession of the Earth’s orbit.</li>
                            <li>The animation starts at noon on the 1st day of the month of Thoth in the first year of the reign of Babylonian King
                                Nabonassar.(Feb 26th 747BC). This is the "epoch" used for Ptolemy's planetary models as they
                                were calibrated from observations beginning near that time.
