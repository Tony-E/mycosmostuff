                        <ul>
                            <li>Ptolemy bases his theory of the Sun on the work of Hipparchus, calibrated using observations from the Babylonian 
                                Astronomical Diaries going back over 700 years.</li>
                            <li>The ecliptic is the reference plane and the vernal equinox <b class='sbold'> ϒ</b> is the reference point.</li> 
                            <li>Coordinates are described in terms of longitude (relative to <b class='sbold'>ϒ </b>) and latitude relative to the ecliptic. </li>
                            <li>The Earth is in the centre of the Universe and consists of the “spheres” of earth, water, air and fire, 
                                as described by Aristotle. The Sun and Moon revolve round the Earth.</li>
                            <li>The ecliptic mean Sun <b class='sbold'>S’</b> is positioned based on its mean angular velocity, west-to-east, relative 
                                to the vernal equinox <b class='sbold'>ϒ</b>. </li>
                            <li>An eccentric <b class='sbold'> E </b> is placed at distance <b class='sbold'> e </b> from the Earth in a direction 
                                that rotates round Earth, east-to-west, with angular velocity equal the the synodic mean angular velocity 
                                of the Moon, relative to the direction of the ecliptic mean Sun <b class='sbold'>S'</b>.
                           
                          
                             <ul><li> The Moon's synodic mean angular velocity is its average angular velocity to rotate from Full Moon to Full Moon. 
                                    This was established using observations spanning over 700 years and is highly accurate.
                                 </li></ul></li>
                            <li> A deferent circle is drawn with radius <b class='sbold'>R</b>, centred on <b class='sbold'>E</b>.</li>
                            <li>A vector from Earth to the point <b class='sbold'>C</b> is drawn such that it rotates with uniform angular motion, west-to-east, 
                                with angular velocity equal to the Moon's mean synodic period, relative to the direction of the ecliptic mean Sun <b class='sbold'>S'</b>.</li>
                            <li>An epicycle circle is drawn with radius <b class='sbold'>r</b>, centred on <b class='sbold'>C</b>.</li>
                            <li>The point <b class='sbold'>E'</b> is established directly opposite <b class='sbold'>E</b>. </li> 
                            <li>The Moon rotates round the epicycle, east-to-west, at an angular rate equal to its mean anomalistic 
                                period, relative to the direction of the vector <b class='sbold'>E'-C</b>. 
                                <ul><li>The Anomalistic period is the average period to return to the same observed 
                                        angular velocity.</li></ul></li>
                            <li>The entire structure is tilted at an angle of 5 degrees to the ecliptic, 
                                representing the inclination of the Moon's orbit.The direction of the tilt (ascending node) migrates by
                                0.053 degrees per day east-to-west.</li> 
                            <li>Ptolemy established <b class='sbold'>e=10.31666, R= 49.68333 and r=5.52</b> using arbitrary units of measurement. </li>
                            <li>The animation starts on the 1st day of the month of Thoth in the first year of the reign of Babylonian King
                                Nabonassar.(Feb 26th 747BC). This is the "epoch" used for Ptolemy's planetary models as they
                                were calibrated from observations beginning near that time.
