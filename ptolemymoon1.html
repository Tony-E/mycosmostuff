                            <h2>Ptolemy's Moon</h2>
                        
                            <p>Ptolemy's model of the Moon's motion is based on the work of Hipparchus but with 
                                extra features related to "evection" and "prosneusis of the epicycle". </p>
                            <p>The Moon revolves around the Earth, but its motion is quite irregular:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Moon's orbit is eccentric and this causes its apparent angular velocity to vary.</li>
                                <li>The amount of eccentricity varies during the month due to the gravitational influence of the 
                                    Sun. This secondary effect is called “evection” and was discovered by Ptolemy. </li>
                                <li>The variations in angular velocity are not the same each month. </li>
                                <li>The Moon's orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by about 5 degrees, so we need to
                                     calculate latitude as well as longitude. The direction of 
                                     the "tilt" (ascending node) changes from month to month.  </li>
                            </ul>          
                        <p>We can identify several different "periods" for the Moon's orbit:</p>
                            <ul>
                               <li>Synodic Month: time from New Moon to New Moon.</li>
                               <li>Tropical Month: time to return to the same longitude along the ecliptic.</li>
                               <li>Anomalistic Month: time to return to the same angular velocity.</li>
                               <li>Draconic Month: time return to the same latitude relative to the ecliptic.</li>
                            </ul>                              
                                
                        <p>None of these periods are consistent month-to-month. We may only establish their mean values. 
                        Ptolemy obtained these mean values with great accuracy using observations of Lunar Eclipses 
                        spanning nearly 800 years. <p>
                            
                        <p>In the diagram we see:<p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Earth is in the centre of the Universe and consists of the “spheres” of earth, water, air and fire, 
                                as described by Aristotle. </li>
                            <li>The ecliptic is the reference plane and the vernal equinox <b class='sbold'> ϒ</b> is the reference point.</li> 
                            <li>Coordinates are described in terms of longitude (relative to <b class='sbold'>ϒ </b>) 
                                and latitude relative to the ecliptic. </li>
                            <li>The Ecliptic Mean Sun <b class='sbold'>λm☉</b> rotates round Earth, west-to-east 
                                once per tropical year, with uniform angular velocity. </li>
                            <li>The mean Moon <b class='sbold'>λm</b> rotates round Earth, west-to-east, once per synodic month, 
                                with uniform angular velocity . </li> 
                            
                            <li>The line of apsides <b class='sbold'>λa</b> rotates round Earth, east-to-west, 
                                once per synodic month, with uniform angular velocity relative to the direction of the mean Sun
                                <b class='sbold'>λm☉</b>. </li>
                            <li>An eccentric <b class='sbold'> D </b> is placed at distance <b class='sbold'> e </b> from the Earth 
                                along the line of apsides <b class='sbold'>λa</b>.</li>
                            <li>A deferent circle is placed with radius <b class='sbold'>R</b>, centred on <b class='sbold'>D</b>.</li>
                            <li>The centre of an epicycle <b class='sbold'>C</b> rotates around the deferent circle, west-to-east, 
                                once per synodic month with motion that is uniform as seen from Earth.(I.e., in the direction 
                                of the mean Moon <b class='sbold'>λm</b>.)</li>
                            <li>An epicycle is drawn with radius <b class='sbold'>r</b>, centred on <b class='sbold'>C</b>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With this arrangement:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The epicycle centre <b class='sbold'>C</b> moves closer to, and further from, Earth thus modifying 
                                its effect on the apparent angular motion at different times of the month.</li>
                            <li>The vector from Earth to <b class='sbold'>C</b> is in uniform motion, so rotation around the deferent
                                circle cannot be uniform relative to its centre <b class='sbold'>D</b>. That is “breaking the rules” 
                                according to Greek philosophy, but Ptolemy does not seem to worry and makes no comment about it. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Uniform rotation around the epicycle does not satisfy the the observed positions of
                            the Moon at the Octants (half way between the quarters), so an additional construct is used. This
                            is sometimes called "prosneusis of the epicycle":</p>
                        <ul>        
                            <li>The point <b class='sbold'>D'</b> is established directly opposite <b class='sbold'>D</b>. </li> 
                            <li>The Moon rotates round the epicycle, east-to-west, at an angular rate equal to its mean anomalistic 
                                period, relative to the direction of the vector <b class='sbold'>D'C</b>. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>And finally, to account for variations of latitude: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The entire structure is projected onto a plane set at an angle of 5 degrees to the ecliptic. </li>
                            <li>The direction of the tilt (ascending node <b class='sbold'>&Omega;</b> ) migrates by 0.053 
                                degrees per day east-to-west.</li> 
                            <li>This is not a true representation of inclination, but that is the way Ptolemy handled variations in latitude
                                and it does not introduce much error.</li>
                        </ul>    
                        
                        <p> Ptolemy established the values <b class='sbold'>R=49.6833</b> and <b class='sbold'>e=10.3166</b> 
                            and <b class='sbold'>r=5.25</b>. These values are in arbitrary units or "partes" that have no 
                            physical meaning. <p>
                        <p>The animation starts at noon on the 1st day of the month of Thoth in the first year of the reign of Babylonian King
                            Nabonassar.(Feb 26th 747BC, JD 1448273.0). This is the "epoch" used for Ptolemy's planetary models as they
                            were calibrated from observations beginning near that time.</p>
