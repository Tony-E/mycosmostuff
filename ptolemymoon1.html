                            <h2>Ptolemy's Moon</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Moon revolves around the Earth - this time we agree!</li>
                            <li>The Moon is difficult because: </li>
                            <li><ul>
                                <li>Its orbit is eccentric and this causes its apparent angular velocity to vary.</li>
                                <li>In addition, the eccentricity varies during the month due 
                                    to the gravitational influence of the Sun. This secondary effect is called 
                                    “Evection” and was discovered by Ptolemy. </li>
                                <li>These variations in angular velocity are not the same each month. </li>
                                 <li>The orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by about 5 degrees and the direction of 
                                     the "tilt" (ascending node) changes by 0.053 degrees per day. We need to
                                     calculate latitude as well as longitude </li>
                                </ul></li>            
                        <li>We can identify several different "periods":</li>
                        <li><ul>
                               <li>Synodic Month: time from New Moon to New Moon.</li>
                               <li>Tropical Month: time to return to the same longitude along the ecliptic.</li>
                                    <li>Anomalistic Month: time to return to the same angular velocity.</li>
                                    <li>Draconic Month: time return to the same latitude relative to the ecliptic.</li>
                            </ul> </li>                               
                                
                        <li>None of these periods are consistent month-to-month. We may only establish their mean values. </li>
                        <li>Based on observations of Lunar Eclipses spanning nearly 800 years, Ptolemy was able to establish
                            the mean value of these periods with sub-second accuracy.</li>
                            
                        <li>In the diagram:</li>
                        <li><ul>
                            <li> The ecliptic is the reference plane and the vernal equinox <b class='sbold'> ϒ</b> is the reference point.</li> 
                                <li>Coordinates are described in terms of longitude (relative to <b class='sbold'>ϒ </b>) and latitude relative to the ecliptic. </li>
                            <li>The Earth is in the centre of the Universe and consists of the “spheres” of earth, water, air and fire, 
                                as described by Aristotle. </li>
                            <li>The ecliptic mean Sun in the direction <b class='sbold'>S’</b> is positioned based on its mean angular velocity, 
                                west-to-east, relative to the vernal equinox <b class='sbold'>ϒ</b>. </li>
                            <li>A simple static eccentric will not account for the variations in angular velocity so an
                                eccentric <b class='sbold'> E </b> is placed at distance <b class='sbold'> e </b> from the Earth in a direction 
                                that rotates round Earth, east-to-west, with angular velocity equal the the synodic mean angular velocity 
                                of the Moon, relative to the direction of the ecliptic mean Sun <b class='sbold'>S'</b>.</li>
                           
                            <li> A deferent circle is drawn with radius <b class='sbold'>R</b>, centred on <b class='sbold'>E</b>.</li>
                            <li>A vector from Earth to the point <b class='sbold'>C</b> is drawn such that it rotates round Earth with uniform angular motion, west-to-east, 
                                with angular velocity equal to the Moon's mean synodic period, relative to the direction of the ecliptic mean Sun <b class='sbold'>S'</b>.</li>
                            <li>An epicycle circle is drawn with radius <b class='sbold'>r</b>, centred on <b class='sbold'>C</b>.</li>
                            </ul></li>
                            <li>With this arrangement:</li>
                            <li><ul>
                            <li>The epicycle centre <b class='sbold'>C</b> moves closer and further from Earth thus modifying 
                                    its effect on the apparent angular motion.</li>
                            <li>The vector from Earth to <b class='sbold'>C</b> is in uniform motion, so rotation around the deferent
                                    circle cannot be uniform relative to its centre <b class='sbold'>E</b>. That is “breaking the rules” 
                                    according to Greek philosophy, but Ptolemy does not seem to worry and makes no comment about it. </li>
                            <li>The calculation of the position of <b class='sbold'>C</b> is complex. Ptolemy used a simplified, but accurate, 
                                    method when preparing his tables. I use a similar method to draw the motion of <b class='sbold'>C</b> 
                                    in the diagram.</li> 
                            <li>The values <b class='sbold'>R=49.6833</b> and <b class='sbold'>e=10.3166</b> and <b class='sbold'>r=5.25</b>
                                were established in arbitrary units that have no physical meaning. </li>
                                </ul></li>
                            <li> Simple rotation around the epicycle would not satisfy the  the observed motion at first and last quarter,
                                so another construct is used:</li>
                            <li><ul>        
                            <li>The point <b class='sbold'>E'</b> is established directly opposite <b class='sbold'>E</b>. </li> 
                            <li>The Moon rotates round the epicycle, east-to-west, at an angular rate equal to its mean anomalistic 
                                period, relative to the direction of the vector <b class='sbold'>E'-C</b>. </li>
                                </ul></li>
                        <li>And finally, to supply the variations of latitude: </li>
                        <li><ul>
                            <li>The entire structure is tilted at an angle of 5 degrees to the ecliptic, 
                                representing the inclination of the Moon's orbit.</li>
                            <li>The direction of the tilt (ascending node <b class='sbold'>&Omega;</b> ) migrates by 0.053 degrees per day east-to-west.</li> 
                            </ul></li>    
                        <li>The animation starts on the 1st day of the month of Thoth in the first year of the reign of Babylonian King
                            Nabonassar.(Feb 26th 747BC). This is the "epoch" used for Ptolemy's planetary models as they
                            were calibrated from observations beginning near that time.</li>
